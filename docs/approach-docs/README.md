# Journaly Approach Docs

At Journaly we use approch docs -- also known as *design docs* -- to propose an "approach" to building something new or enhancing something existing.

## The Process

1. We create an issue to outline the initial problem we want to solve.
2. We create a Pull Request where we write a first draft and can easily collaborate to refine the approach.
3. Once we have a final draft, we can merge this in and begin work.

## Naming Convention

Currently, the convention is to prefix the file with the `type`, followed by the name.
For example:
- `system-svg.md` for a doc that proposes a `system` for how we use SVGs
- `feature-inline-feedback-exp.md` for a doc that proposes how to approach building our in-line feedback experience `feature`

## Types

The existing types are:

- `system-` for a `system` or set of conventions
- `feature-` for creating a new or enhancing an existing `feature`
